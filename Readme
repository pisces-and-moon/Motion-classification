To create the videos and images in the report, please follow the below instructions.
1. Download the files pf.py and pf_experiment.py. pf.py includes the basic functions and pf_experiment.py will run these functions and produce images and videos.
   Put these two files under the directory of Python. 
2. Please creat a folder named "input_videos" under python directory and put all the videos in the zip file in the input_video folder. 
3. Please put the files "image" and "label" also in the "input_video" folder. These two contained the obtained Hu moments vectors and their corresponding labels for all the 
frames. By directly import these files it can save the time to run the Hu moment calculations on all the video files. 
4. Please Create a new folder names as "output", this will store the output videos and images. 
5. Open Python shell, and type the following:
	from pf_experiment import *
	clf = pf_test(K=5)
	clf.part1()
	E, T, e, t = clf.part2()
	clf.part3()
	clf.part4()
part1() will produce the motion history images in report Results and Discussion Part 1. 
part2() will produce the confusion matrix in report Results and Discussion Part 2. E is the confusion matrix for training. T is for testing. e is the average accuracy for training
set and t is the average accuracy for testing set. 
part3() will produce the labeled videos for single action.
part4() will produce the labeled videos for multiple actions.
